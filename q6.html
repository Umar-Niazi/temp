    <h1>Welcome to Task 6 Web Page</h1>
    
    <p>
        My First Paragraph,<br> 
        This website has alot of features including making text look <strong>strong</strong> text and also <em>italic</em> text.
        You can make text look either <del>deleted</del> and look <ins>inserted</ins>.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        My Second Paragraph,<br>
        It doesn't just stop there, we also have <sub>subscript</sub> text and some <sup>superscript</sup> text. 
        Furthermore, we have <b>bold</b> text and also <u>underline</u> text, and if the need for <q>qoutes</q> arise then we have that too.<br>
